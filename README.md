# Law enforcing end-to-end asymmetric encryption key agreement scheme
A protocol capable of individually backdooring E2E encrypted secret communication for use by multiple independent state authorities.

Its core idea is as follows:
* first the parties who wish to communicate, establish key agreements with their dedicated local authorities' servers
* then they apply the key values agreed upon with the diverse authorities as the final key agreement's secret values inbetween the two of them

As long as powers in a liberal democracy can be _securely_ separated, sheer theoretically it is possible, that only dedicated people get eavesdropped, whose communication raises established suspition of breaking _useful_ laws. As the author and inventor of this protocol I do not believe currently in the security of power branch separations in the free world being safe enough, but I do believe that privacy is a basic human right which needs utmost protection. Privacy is so elementary among others, because data mining enables fine tuned manipulation and law making that have never been seen before and artificial intelligence will or already poses a threat of spreading unprecedented amounts of fake information, which both methods get even more efficient if people's communication can be monitored and used as feedback for such processes.
