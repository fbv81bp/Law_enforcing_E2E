The "e2ee_backdooring" protocol needs to be hardened against observation of the very last partial key result exchange, because otherwise only a single authority - the owner of the exponent used as last - is capable of spying in on the endpoints with the help of its own key portions.

1) A particular solution is starting with as many seeds as there are authorities and ending every key calculation with another authority's subkey and then mixing these results.
2) Another solution can be obtained by hashing the subkeys and using this common hash as the secret value for deriving thy final keys of the communicating parties.
